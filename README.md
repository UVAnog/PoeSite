Poes Site
Nolan Harris 
University of Virginia '22

Poe Site is a site made for my course MDST 3665 Digital Media Accessibility.
Link to site: https://poethecat.netlify.app/index.html

The goal of the course was to learn the ins and outs of what accessibility is, its importance, and how to integrate it from start to finish in what you create. This final site is the implementation of what we learned, the end goal being to produce a fully functional and accessible site.
