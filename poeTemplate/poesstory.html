            <p>A little about me: <br><br>I was found on the side of a busy road in Richmond, Virginia only a few weeks old in July 2020. A woman picked 
                me up began to take care of me. Eventually, I wound up being adopted by a group of college boys 
                at the University of Virginia. I don't know why, but none of them ever left the house, so I got lots 
                of love and attention. My favorite things are taking naps, zooming around after my mouse toys, and trying to 
                escape out the door to the unknown world I am for some reason prevented from exploring. <br><br> My story just 
                started, I'm just a kitten. But I have something important to share. There are a lot of other cats and dogs like 
                me who maybe don't have families to live with. This is why adoption is very important, and helps pets like me find
                new homes. I've got some things below you should check out to find out why it's great to adopt animals, and
                maybe even find a way to gain another member to your family.  <br><br> Thanks so much for coming to see me!<br><br>

            <p> 
                [0:00] Whooshing sound introduction <br><br>
                [Gram Seymour]  0:11 <br> 
                Did you know that 3.3 million dogs
                are in shelters, and 1.6 million are
                rescued and
                born in the worst place possible? They
                are confined overcrowded and set to
                sleep in their own excrete,
                ten thousand popping meals are in the
                usa licensed and unlicensed.
                Also they drink inadequate and
                unsanitary completing water.
                Lastly 1.2 million dogs are euthanized
                or killed in mills every year.
                If you turn to the screen behind you
                this is what my dog looked like before
                when you bought her at the house as well
                as after they got her
                keep in mind that you when you are
                rescuing dogs you are saving them from a
                horrible life. <br><br>[0:46]<br>
                You aren't necessarily doing the same
                thing when you shop for a pet in the
                store such as a dog.
                These dogs don't usually,
                my rescue dog is named Tommy she was a
                dog in a pokemon her life,
                before we got her was horrible beyond
                imagination.
                She was born when was giving birth
                before she was even two years old.
                Please take a moment to imagine what
                your life would be like if you were a
                dog in the mill.
                Henry was skinny and had puppies way too
                much, her life is so much better. <br><br> [1:19] <br>
                She gets to sleep on the couch with her
                stepbrother and she has so many toys
                and during parties her brother and her
                watch tv.
                Usually she is being lazy in her crate
                she is in her great home,
                that is what we call it if she was not
                in health right she would be eating
                anything she treats.
                I have another mill i have another story
                about a male dog named tracy
                to december 19 2017.
                tracy lived in an amish puppy mill she
                almost died and was not eating for about
                two weeks
                her breeder brought her to that clinic
                she was starving dehydrated and had a
                low body temperature.
                she was going to be killed because her
                brother would not spend the money to do
                diagnostic testing there was no hope for
                tracy but the vet
                thought she deserved a chance and will
                do her best to save her she made it
                through the night.
                then that called a boxer rescue
                she was only four years old she has had
                a foster home with a male foster job and
                they were in september.
                thousand pumpkin mills probably have one
                of the hardest laughter
                want you to picture yourself as a dog in
                a podcast. <br><br> [2:27] <br>
                If you imagine a life full of darkness
                this is what a mill is like.
                On your way out there will be a box set

                donating to this boxer dog rescue adopt

                this is what she would say to you: "Saving
                one animal won't change the world, but it
                will change the world for that one
                animal."

                <p> 
                    [0:00]<br>
                    [Sophie Clark] *Clears Throat* <br>
                    Adopt don't shop. I see this phrase all the time. Whether it be on bumper stickers t shirts or flyers, it always sparked my 
                    curiosity by never even bothered to look into the problem. Once I did take the time and effort to understand, I've never looked back. 
                    Today, I will let you in on the issues of dog breeding in the US. I will inform you of the consequences of selective dog breeding and 
                    convince you why you should indeed adopt a dog from a shelter instead of shopping for a dog from a breeder. Together we could change the 
                    narrative of shelter dogs and save many lives by volunteer not buy from breeders. According to the ASPCA or the American Society for the 
                    Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, around 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized in the US each year. This is due to an influx of 
                    animals enter the shelter each year and create overcrowding. An average of half animals that enter the shelter each year don't get 
                    adopted. Why is this the case? Dog breeders capitalize on cute designer dogs like golden doodles, or even more ancient breeds like pugs 
                    have such distinct looks are made desirable by popular media. It is also seen as an easier route to go through a breeder to get the doggy 
                    want them to go through a shelter. Who most people don't know is that breeding dogs for specific traits or selective breeding is actually 
                    quite harmful to the dogs themselves. <br><br> [1:22] <br>
                    According to the National humane education society, selective breeding puts purebred dogs at a risk of many health problems. harmful recessive traits 
                    are only heightened by the inbreeding of purebred dogs. For example, pugs, with their desirable and cute flat face are at an increased risk of breeding 
                    eye problems throughout their lives. These dogs spend their lives with pain and suffering in the pursuit of being cute and desirable. When 
                    these health problems seem to be too much or cost too much for an owner to handle. They're often handed over to shelters. In fact, 25% of shelter dogs 
                    are purebred. And according to the ASPCA National rihani survey, pet problems including health problems are cited as a reason for rehome me for half the 
                    dogs brought to the shelter. Breeding dogs not only takes away the chance for a shelter dog to get adopted, but contributes to the problem overall. 
                    Unfortunately, breeding continues to be the top method for people acquiring the dog in the US. Data from the Humane Society estimates a little over 
                    1 million selective bred puppies are born each year in the US alone. Even more tragic is that many come from an estimated 10,000 American puppy mills 
                    that focus on profit rather than living standards. <br><br> [2:37] <br>
                    Adopting a dog from a shelter or rescue instead of a selective breeder helps to take away support 
                    and demand for selective bred puppies. Better yet, shelter dogs are better cost option according to pack for animals. The overall cost for shelter dog 
                    adoption, upwards to $600. While shell or voila selective bred puppy can total up to $6,000. The price for the shelter dog goes right back into 
                    support for other rescues as well. The Humane Society accounts 39% of their revenue to adoption fees alone. Not to mention shelter dogs who are often 
                    mixed breed will live longer and healthier lives with less medical bills overall, a rescue dog adoption is truly guilt free. Now the ASPCA estimates 
                    that nearly all that nearly half of all Americans own a dog. 
                    <br><br> [3:25] <br>
                    So this problem affects a lot of us. What do we do now, the phrase adopt don't shop started 
                    in California and soon spread. California continues to be a forefront of justice for shelter dogs in 2017. California actually pass it act titled the 
                    pet rescue adoption act of California, which requires all pet shops like dogs to source a dog from a shelter or rescue group instead of a breeder. 
                    If California could pass a law like this other states could too, is up to responsible and caring dog owners and lovers. To keep the spirit of the pet 
                    rescue and adoption act as well as the phrase adopt don't shop in order to make a change for the well being of shelter dogs. Here's what you can do to make a 
                    difference. Remain educated on the consequences of selective dog breeding and spread your knowledge to friends and family. encourage those in the market for 
                    a dog to consider adoption. lobby against selective breeding or even simpler put your money where your mouth is refuse to buy from and support selective breeders 
                    support local shelters and stuff. <br><br> [4:27] <br>
                    Together we can make a difference and save dog lives. While the use of nature rate of shelter animals could be reduced 
                    to zero. This is a real possibility to alter breeding. Selective dog breeding needs to be stopped in order to achieve the salvation of shelter dogs. 
                    If no action is taken and selected, radios continue to profit. 1 million more shelter animal lives will be lost each year. So take a stand against luckier
                    breeding and stand up for shelter animals. Consider taking the phrase adopt don't shop yourself. Maybe you could have the car with the bumper sticker or the T shirt.
                    educate others you could be the difference. Next time you are someone who knows considering a new dog member of the family. Remember the 
                    consequences of selective breeding and make the choice to save a life instead.
